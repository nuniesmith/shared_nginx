# FKS Services Auto-Discovery Template
# This file is generated from environment variables

# Include this in your main nginx.conf:
# include /etc/nginx/conf.d/fks-services.conf;

# Service upstreams will be auto-generated based on FKS_*_HOST and FKS_*_PORT variables
# Example:
# upstream fks-api {
#     server ${FKS_API_HOST:-fks-api}:${FKS_API_PORT:-8001};
# }

# Health check for nginx itself
server {
    listen 8090;
    server_name localhost;
    
    location /health {
        access_log off;
        return 200 '{"status":"healthy","service":"fks-nginx","environment":"${FKS_ENVIRONMENT}"}';
